### cardsToShow
First things first, we will start by defining our `cardsToShow` function, this will return the number of cards we need to
show depending on the screen size.

``` js
  // This will give us the width of the viewport every time the window size changes
  const { width } = useWindowDimensions();

  // This will give us the number of cards we need to show depending on the screen size
  const cardsToShow = (arr) => {
    if (width > 1280) {
      return 4;
    }
    if (width > 1040) {
      return 3;
    }
    if (width > 768) {
      return 2;
    }
    return arr.length;
  };

```
### Defining our state

Next we need to define our state, we have to make a copy of `movies.popular` and assign it to popular variable.
We need to do this as when we run the `slice` method as it will change the original array and we don't want 
this to happen on our movies.popular array. Next we define our `startIndex`, this is what we will use to 
find the index of the first card we want to show. Then we define the `endIndex`, this will be used to 
find the index of the last card we want to show however, we set the original state of `endIndex`
to `cardsToShow(movies.popular)`. For example, if the screen is greater than 1280px, `cardsToShow`
will return 4, so our endIndex will be set to 4. Lastly, we need to define our paginatedMovies and
its original state will be set to `popular.slice(startIndex, endIndex)`.


``` jsx

  // Set up the states we will need for our pagination
  let popular = [...movies.popular];
  const [startIndex, setStartIndex] = useState(0);
  const [endIndex, setEndIndex] = useState(cardsToShow(movies.popular));
  const [paginatedMovies, setPaginatedMovies] = useState(popular.slice(startIndex, endIndex));
  
```
### Next and Previous buttons

Now we need to make our `next()` and `previous()` functions, these will update our cards when the user
clicks on the next or previous buttons, remember the next and previous buttons are children of the `<PaginationButtons />`
component so we will need to pass our functions to the `<PaginationButtons />` component as props. After that `<PaginationButtons />`
will do all the heavy lifting for us, for example disabling and changing the styles of the buttons. 

![Screenshots of pagination buttons](/img/unit-2/pagination-cards-with-buttons.png)

When the `next()` function is fired, we first need to check if our `endIndex` state is less than the length of our
`movies.popular` array. This is because if it isn't these means we have no more cards to show. If our endIndex state is
less than the length of movies.popular we add 1 to the current startIndex and endIndex.

``` js

const next = () => {
  if (endIndex < movies.popular.length) {
    setStartIndex(startIndex + 1);
    setEndIndex(endIndex + 1);
  }
};

```

When the `previous()` function is fired, we first need to check if our `startIndex` state is greater than 0, this
is because if our startIndex is 0 this means we can't have any previous card to show. If the startIndex is greater than
0 we need to minus 1 from our current startIndex and endIndex state.

``` js

const previous = () => {
  if (startIndex > 0) {
    setStartIndex(startIndex - 1);
    setEndIndex(endIndex - 1);
  }
};

```

Next we need pass our `next()` and `previous()` functions as props to the `<PaginationButtons />` component as
previously mentioned. Add we need to set the `disableLeft` prop to true if the `startIndex` state is equal to true
and set the `disableRight` prop to true if the `endIndex` state is equal to the length of the `movies.popular` array.

``` jsx

<PaginationButtons
  next={next}
  previous={previous}
  disableLeft={startIndex === 0}
  disableRight={endIndex === movies.popular.length}
/>

```




Lastly, we render our `paginatedMovies` array using the array map method,

``` jsx

{paginatedMovies.map((movie) => (
  <Card movie={movie} key={movie.imdbID} />
))}

```
