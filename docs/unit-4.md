## React Router

In the section we will be covering React Router, specifically [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com/). So what is React router anyway? 

> React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

However, it is important to understand that we will be using React Router for client-side not server-side routing. What this means is that will are not actually loading a new page when we navigate to a new route (unlike server-side routing), It will look like we have but under the hood React Router will update our UI and URL but not actually load a new page.
